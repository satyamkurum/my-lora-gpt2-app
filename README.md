#  LoRA Fine-Tuned GPT-2: Quotes, Poems & Conversations Generator

This project fine-tunes OpenAI’s GPT-2 using the [LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) technique on a curated dataset of:

- 💬 Human-like conversations (Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus)
- ✍️ Motivational quotes
- 📜 English poems

The final model is lightweight (~7MB adapter) and runs efficiently on CPUs/GPUs — deployable as a web app using [Gradio](https://gradio.app).

## 🚀 Features

- 🔧 Fine-tuned using **PEFT (LoRA)** for fast, memory-efficient training
- 🗣️ Generates realistic dialogues, motivational lines, and poetic verses
- 🧠 Uses GPT-2 as the base model
- 🌐 Web interface powered by **Gradio**
- ☁️ Easy to deploy on **Hugging Face Spaces** or **AWS EC2**
