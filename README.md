# LoRA Fine-Tuned GPT : Quotes, Poems & Conversations Generator

This project fine-tunes OpenAI’s GPT-2 using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique on a curated dataset of:

-  Human-like conversations (Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus)
-  Motivational quotes
-  English poems

The final model is lightweight (~7MB adapter) and runs efficiently on CPUs/GPUs.

##  Features

-  Fine-tuned using **PEFT (LoRA)** for fast, memory-efficient training
-  Generates realistic dialogues, motivational lines, and poetic verses
-  Uses GPT-2 as the base model
-  Web interface powered by **Gradio**
-  Easy to deploy on **Hugging Face Spaces** or **AWS EC2**

##  Model Training Summary

-  **Base model:** GPT-2 (`117M`)
-  **LoRA adapters:** Trained using PEFT on ~700MB+ combined dataset
-  **Datasets:**
  - Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus (chats)
  - Motivational Quotes (Hugging Face)
  - Poems Dataset
